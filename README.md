 Why I Made This
As someone diving into cybersecurity , I wanted a tool that:

Doesn't rely on websites to generate secure passwords

Is lightweight, offline, and transparent

Gives users full control over how strong they want their password to be

Plus, it's fun to build tools you'll actually use 

 Future Improvements
Add GUI (Tkinter or PyQt5)

Auto-save password to encrypted vault

Add password strength scoring algorithm

Export as executable (.exe)
